# gesture-mouse-control2

### Brief
Control computer cursor by using a webcam and gestures using geometric methods. No other equipment required.  
Still at early stage -- adding classes to get my job done. Functionality I need, as Python classes is:  
- [x] Adaptive skin detector
- [x] grabcut as alternative/ enhancer for skin detector? Used as ground truth generator.
- [x] Interactive image cropper to extract a skin sample (MouseRoi.py)
- [x] Lucas-Kanade tracker to track hand features (LkTracker.py)
- [ ] Contour, convex hull finder, gesture estimator
- [ ] Face removal module
- [ ] Hand centre estimator. Centroid? Max inscribed circle?
- [ ] Library to interface with cursor 
- [ ] Unit tests
